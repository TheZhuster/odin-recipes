A website linking to 3 different recipes from the index page, inspired by 
https://www.allrecipes.com/.

This was a project carried out to build my HTML chops as I began learning its
fundamentals, which includes the language's boilerplate, headers (w/ differing
levels), lists (both ordered and unordered), anchors for links, images, 
paragraphs, paths (both relative and absolute), and linkage to other sources.

Improvements to make: center top header, downsize image
